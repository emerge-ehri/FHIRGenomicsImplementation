Star alleles are determined based on the variants detected by this assay. Star alleles may not be accurately defined due to the limitations of this assay which include: 1) The presence of additional variants defining functional and non functional alleles in a patient, not detected by this assay, and 2) the lack of ability to determine the phase of the variants when a star allele is defined by multiple variants. Additionally, undetected genetic and/or non genetic factors such as drug-drug interactions, may also impact the phenotype. This pharmacogenomic report is limited to CPIC level A alleles and drug recommendations. Additional (level B and lower) drugs may be metabolized by these reported enzymes; and additional enzymes, not reported here, may affect the metabolism of a reported drug. Refer to the current recommendation for dosage guidelines. See Methodology for details.",

    "1. eMERGE-Seq Version 2 NGS Panel: for the paired-end pre-capture library procedure, genome DNA is fragmented by sonicating genome DNA and ligating to the Illumina multiplexing PE adapters (reference 1).  The adapter-ligated DNA is then PCR amplified using primers with sequencing barcodes (indexes). For target enrichment capture procedure, the pre-capture library is enriched by hybridizing to biotin labeled in-solution probes&nbsp;(reference 2) at&nbsp; 56&deg;C for 16 - 19 hours.&nbsp; For massively parallel sequencing, the post-capture library DNA is subjected to sequence analysis on Illumina HiSeq platform for 100 bp paired-end reads. The following quality control metrics of the sequencing data are generally achieved: &gt;70% of reads aligned to target, &gt;99% target base covered at &gt;20X, &gt;98% target base covered at &gt;40X, average coverage of target bases &gt;200X. SNP concordance to SNPTrace genotype array: &gt;99%. This test may not provide detection of certain genes or portions of certain genes due to local sequence characteristics or the presence of closely related pseudogenes. Gross deletions or duplications, changes from repetitive sequences may not be accurately identified by this methodology. Genomic rearrangements cannot be detected by this assay.",
    "2. As a quality control measure, the individual's DNA is also analyzed by a SNP-array (Fluidigm SNPTrace panel (reference 3) ). The SNP data are compared with the NGS panel data to ensure correct sample identification and to assess sequencing quality.",
    "3. Data are analyzed by the Mercury 3.4 (reference 4) pipeline. The output data from Illumina HiSeq are converted from bcl file to FastQ file by Illumina bcl2fastq 1.8.3 software, and mapped to the hg19 human genome reference by the BWA program (reference 5). The variant calls are performed using Atlas-SNP and Atlas-indel developed in-house by BCM HGSC. Copy number variants were detected using Atlas-pcnv v0, developed in-house by the BCM HGSC. Variant annotations are performed using the Cassandra tool, developed in-house.  Neptune version $VERSION was used to match variants against curated variants in the VIP database version [2020-04-17-14-15-09.vip] and generate this report.**",
    "4. The variants were interpreted according to ACMG guidelines (reference 6) and patient phenotypes.  Synonymous variants, intronic variants not affecting splicing site, and common benign variants are excluded from interpretation unless they were previously reported as pathogenic variants. Reviewed variants are added to the VIP database for inclusion on future reports.  It should be noted that the interpretation of the data is based on our current understanding of genes and variants at the time of reporting.",
